# Pose Transmitter

This Python project uses OpenCV to read images or videos and then uses TensorFlow and MoveNet models to estimate the pose of a human.</br>
Heavily inspired by [TensorFlow Lite Pose Estimation Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/pose_estimation/overview) actually, this is where I took the code provided in the examples to interact with TF. </br> >
The input can be a video file or webcam input.</br>
Finally, the information inferred by the TensorFlow model is transmitted via UDP packets to a user-defined server.

## Usage

You can run the code from the console using the following format:

`python ./pose_transmitter/main.py --video_source 0 --host_ip 127.0.0.1 --host_port 4900 --debug`

or:

`python ./pose_transmitter/main.py --video_source some_video.mp4`

or simply:

`python ./pose_transmitter/main.py`

The default value for the host is `127.0.0.1`, and for the port `4900`.

## UDP Message Structure

The messages are serialized with the library [msgpack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) and sent via UDP.</br>
They have the following structure:

```lang-plaintext
    [
        [989.79443359375, 635.7391967773438], 
        [1091.6107177734375, 512.1315307617188], 
        [889.1296997070312, 520.48828125], 
        [1204.3812255859375, 533.4179077148438], 
        ...
    ]
```

Which is a list of positions of the points found by the inference model.

> 📝 __Note__:</br>
> It is worth noting that not all points could be inferred and sent to the list.</br>
> For example, if the camera captures half a body, it will send the information of the points found on that half body.

The list of points follows the logic described in [TensorFlow Lite Pose Estimation Example](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/pose_estimation/overview), i.e.:

|Id| Part|
|-|-|
|0 |nose|
|1 |leftEye|
|2 |rightEye|
|3 |leftEar|
|4 |rightEar|
|5 |leftShoulder|
|6 |rightShoulder|
|7 |leftElbow|
|8 |rightElbow|
|9 |leftWrist|
|10| rightWrist|
|11| leftHip|
|12| rightHip|
|13| leftKnee|
|14| rightKnee|
|15| leftAnkle|
|16| rightAnkle|

## Notes

- The performance can be improved. Since *It works on my machine ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ at a decent framerate, this is left as an exercise to the adventurer souls (which probably is me in the future).
